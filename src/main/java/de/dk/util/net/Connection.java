 * A class to represent a TCP connection based on a {@link Socket}.

 * The connection continuosly reads messages when started. The message reading task can be started

 * Messages can be sent by calling the {@link Connection#send(Serializable)} method.
 * A basic implementation of this class is provided by the {@link SimpleConnection} class.
 * The messages can be channeled using the Channel API.
